**Carnegie:** Trump's legal troubles are a direct result of his own actions. The attempts to overturn the 2020 election and mishandling of classified documents show that no one is above the law.

**Mellon:** Or, it's a political witch hunt. Democrats are orchestrating these cases to damage Trump's reputation ahead of the 2024 election. It's all about politics, not justice.

**Carnegie:** Multiple indictments and ongoing trials do suggest a pattern of behavior that undermines democratic institutions. It's about accountability.

**Mellon:** Accountability, or overreach? Prosecutors are using the justice system as a tool against a political opponent. It's setting a dangerous precedent.

**Carnegie:** The legal system is functioning as intended. The evidence presented in court speaks for itself. Claims of political persecution are unfounded.

**Mellon:** Many of the charges are based on questionable legal theories. Would these charges have been brought against anyone else? I doubt it.

**Carnegie:** Efforts by Trump and his allies to discredit the judicial process are dangerous. They threaten the rule of law itself.

**Mellon:** But look at the media coverage and judicial actions. They're part of a broader effort to silence conservative voices and undermine Trump's movement.

**Carnegie:** The judicial process is there to ensure justice. Trump’s actions are being legally challenged, as they should be, for the sake of democracy.

**Mellon:** Democracy should also protect against the weaponizing of justice. These cases should concern everyone who values fair treatment in the legal system.

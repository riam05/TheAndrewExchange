**Carnegie:** Peter Thiel's warnings really highlight how capitalism has failed younger generations. Just look at unaffordable housing and crushing student debt. These are direct results of deregulation and policies that prioritize the wealthy over working people.

**Mellon:** I see it differently. Thiel's warnings remind us to defend capitalism. Economic hardships can be addressed through market reforms and entrepreneurship, not socialism.

**Carnegie:** But isn't it clear that incremental reforms have failed? We need bold, progressive policies like debt relief, public housing, and stronger social safety nets to tackle systemic inequality.

**Mellon:** The popularity of socialism among young people is more about unrealistic expectations and a lack of understanding of free markets. Abandoning capitalism will stifle innovation and harm economic growth.

**Carnegie:** Dismissing young people's frustrations as 'entitled' is dangerous. Their interest in socialist ideas is a rational response to a system that's rigged against them, not extremism.

**Mellon:** Yet, socialist solutions risk reducing economic growth and harming the very people they're supposed to help. We should focus on expanding opportunities for ownership and wealth creation.

**Carnegie:** Thiel's framing of socialism as a threat misses the point. It's a necessary corrective after decades of policies benefitting older, wealthier Americans at the expense of the young.

**Mellon:** His concerns about 'proletarianizing' youth should be a call to action for policymakers: expand opportunities within the capitalist framework, rather than abandoning it for left-wing economics.

**Carnegie:** The rise of socialist candidates and ideas reflects a demand for a fairer system. It's about addressing inequality, not destroying capitalism.

**Mellon:** And I believe the best way to address inequality is by enhancing the free market, ensuring everyone has the opportunity to thrive through innovation and entrepreneurship.
